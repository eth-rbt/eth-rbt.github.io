            <h2>My Vision</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Interactions are at the heart of human connection. As humans, we inherently crave these connectionsâ€”whether to other people, cultures, or the world around us. The ways we interact define the depth and form of those relationships.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The way we interact decides what form of connections we build. Interaction here refers to a reciprocal action, influence, or communication between two or more entities. Normally it starts with us doing something, and then the second party, which can be another person, the world, or an object, does something back.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Creating quality interactions is crucial. Growing up in a strict Taiwanese private school, social media dominated my generation's lives. Kids rushed home to immerse themselves in their online worlds. Yet, I found my connection in a little black notebook shared among close friends. Each day, we'd take turns bringing it home, writing, doodling, and leaving colorful comments. It became a shared canvas of thoughts, drawings, pictures, stickers and sometimes coded messages. It was personal. It was real. That notebook made me feel deeply connected to my friends and, in its own small way, to the world. Far more than any digital platform could.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We also interact with the world through text, music, gestures, and thoughts. In college, I discovered freestyle dancing. One night in Aruba, feeling overwhelmed, I found myself alone on a quiet beach. I played music and danced under the moonlight. Thirty minutes later, I was lying on the sand, exhausted, panting, and crying. I had poured everything out as if the world itself was holding space for me. That moment taught me something: how we interact with the world shapes our emotional experiences.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Can we create more of these meaningful interactions in life?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">As technology evolves, we have to ask ourselves: are we creating tools that bring us closer or push us apart? With AI replicating vulnerability and shared experiences, authenticity is increasingly fragile. Did your friend really write that thoughtful message? How do we hold on to culture and identity when everything can be generated?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">At the same time, I see incredible potential for technology to deepen these connections. What if visual tools could help the blind see images? What if musicians and dancers could collaborate in ways we haven't even imagined? What if storytelling platforms could allow people to share their lived experiences across languages and cultures, creating empathy and understanding on a global scale?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">As a designer, I believe if we keep designing for humans, the quality and authenticity of interactions will be elevated in unprecedented ways.</p>
