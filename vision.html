            <p class="mb-4">Interactions are at the heart of human connection. As humans, we inherently crave these connections to other people, cultures, or the world around us. The ways we interact define the depth and form of those relationships; they also define who we are as individuals.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Today, most interactions with technology are flat and uniform. Devices behave the same way regardless of who is using them, where they are, or why they are engaged. A lamp is a switch, and a speaker still waits for commands to play music. The most adaptive technologies we have are screens, which concentrate personalization by pulling us into content, where we now spend an average of six to seven hours a day.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">What if physical objects could be as adaptive and expressive as the screens we design for today? </p>
            <p class="mb-4">There is another world where screenless physical products, with the same hardware interfaces, can have diverse and personalized interactions that are as interesting as screens. I am interested in this group of objects called “adaptive objects.” They keep their physical form, but as the software changes, they exhibit diverse outputs and modalities of interaction. They are physical artifacts whose identities and modalities shift through software, context, and learning, while remaining grounded in the real world.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Imagine a boombox that translates motion into music differently for each situation or dance style. Or an AI parrot that lives alongside a family, acting as a child's music tutor in one moment and a shopping buddy in another. These are now design spaces made possible by software that can handle ambiguity, non-determinism, and situated behavior, and can create more rigorous interpersonal dynamics as they depart from screens.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Adaptive objects redistribute agency back to people. Rather than adapting ourselves to rigid interfaces, we can shape how objects behave around us, sculpting interactions that fit our bodies, routines, relationships, and environments. Individuals will be able to sculpt the interactions around them within the rich physical landscape and truly design the environment they live in every day.</p>
